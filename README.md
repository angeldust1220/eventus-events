I developed an event hosting service with features like user authentication, event management, search, filtering, categories, checkout, and payments. I'll be using Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, React Hook Form, Zod, Uploadthing, React-Datepicker, Mongoose, Clerk for authentication, and Stripe for payments.
